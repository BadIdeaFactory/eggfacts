## Eggs as the start of life

An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an ovum.

Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some do not, such as scorpions and most mammals.

chicken eggs can be grown and hatched without their shells

Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water, and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible.

Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a favorable temperature range (warm) while the embryo grows.

The largest recorded egg is from a whaleshark, and was 11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in size; whale shark eggs normally hatch within the mother.

The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz).

Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed "spores," or in spermatophytes "seeds," or in gametophytes "egg cells."

he default color of vertebrate eggs is the white of the calcium carbonate from which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly passerines, produce colored eggs.

Most bird eggs have an oval shape, with one end rounded and the other more pointed. This shape results from the egg being forced through the oviduct. Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward.

Many animals feed on eggs.

Often the sex of the developing reptile embryo is determined by the temperature of the surroundings, with cooler temperatures favouring males.

The most common reproductive strategy for fish is known as oviparity, in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male.
